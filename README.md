# Robosoc_Swarm
## Introduction
Swarm robotics is a rapidly evolving field within robotics that explores the collective behaviour of multiple robots working together.  Drawing inspiration from the natural world, swarm robotics systems are characterized by decentralized control, simple individual robots, and emergent collective intelligence.  This project investigates the potential of swarm robotics with a focus on decentralized control, where a central unit (mother bot) coordinates smaller worker bots to achieve a common goal.
## Objectives
The primary objective of this project is to design and implement a swarm robotics system with decentralized control.  The project aims to achieve the following objectives:
* Develop a system consisting of a mother bot and worker bots capable of communication and collaboration.
* Implement a decentralized control scheme where the mother bot directs the worker bots based on user commands.
* Explore the use of HTTP commands for user-friendly control of the swarm robotics system.
* Demonstrate the potential applications of the system through practical tasks.
